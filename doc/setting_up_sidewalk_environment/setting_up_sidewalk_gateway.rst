Setting up Sidewalk gateway
###########################

You must set up and enable Sidewalk on the latest generation `Echo`_ device.
The device is used as a Sidewalk gateway and you can configure it with the Alexa app (`iOS`_ or `Android`_).
Once your Sidewalk Endpoint is registered, it will connect to the Sidewalk gateway and communicate with it.

.. note::
   Refer to the `Amazon Sidewalk gateways`_ for the complete list of available devices.

For the exact instructions, refer to the `Setting up a Sidewalk gateway`_ documentation.

.. note::
   If you have multiple Echo devices registered under a single Amazon account, only one of those devices will be able to operate as an FSK gateway even if other devices have the same capability.
   If you need to operate multiple FSK gateways, we recommend setting them up under separate Amazon accounts.
