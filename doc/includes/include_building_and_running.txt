This sample can be found under :file:`samples/sid_end_device`.

.. note::
   Before you flash your Sidewalk sample, make sure you have completed the following:

      * You have set up the Sidewalk repository using the standalone :file:`west.yml` configuration as described in the :ref:`setting_up_sdk` section.
      * You provisioned your device during the :ref:`setting_up_sidewalk_prototype`.

   This step needs to be completed only once.
   You do not have to repeat it for every sample rebuild.

To build the sample, follow the steps in the `Building and programming an application`_ documentation.

To build the sample for sub-GHz (LoRa/FSK) operation, use the ``--shield`` option with ``west build``. This configures the correct device tree overlays and pin mappings for the Semtech SX1262 shield, and enables the correct Sidewalk radio configuration.
