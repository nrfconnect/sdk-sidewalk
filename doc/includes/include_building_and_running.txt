This sample can be found under :file:`samples/sid_end_device`.

.. note::
   Before you flash your Sidewalk sample, make sure you have completed the following:

      * You have set up the Sidewalk repository using the standalone :file:`west.yml` configuration as described in the :ref:`setting_up_sdk` section.
      * You provisioned your device during the :ref:`setting_up_sidewalk_prototype`.

   This step needs to be completed only once.
   You do not have to repeat it for every sample rebuild.

For general instructions on building the sample, follow the steps in the `Building and programming an application`_ documentation.

You can also build the sample with specific configurations:

* For Bluetooth LE only operation, use the default build commands.

  .. parsed-literal::
    :class: highlight

     west build -b *board_target*

* For sub-GHz (LoRa and FSK) operation, use the ``--shield`` option with ``west build``.
  This configures the correct device tree overlays and pin mappings for the Semtech radio shield, and enables the correct Sidewalk radio configuration.
