Automatic Touchless Registration using Sidewalk FFN
###################################################

Touchless registration using Sidewalk FFN is a silent, automatic process that occurs between an unregistered Sidewalk Endpoint and a Sidewalk Gateway over Bluetooth LE.
The endpoint sends Bluetooth LE beacons that are received by the Sidewalk Gateway when the endpoint and gateway are in close proximity.

Ensure your Sidewalk Gateway is opted into Sidewalk, powered on and in close range to your Sidewalk Endpoint.
Successful registration is indicated by the following ``Device Is registered`` log message:

De-registering your Sidewalk Endpoint
*************************************

Under certain situations, you may wish to de-register your endpoint.
For example, if you want to test the registration process multiple times, you will need to de-register your endpoint before attempting to re-register it.

#. Find ``<AWS_ACCESS_KEY>`` and ``<AWS_SECRET_KEY>`` with your AWS credentials.
   You should have made note of these credentials when setting up your AWS account.

   a. In case you need to obtain new keys, navigate to :guilabel:`IAM`, and select :guilabel:`Users`.
   #. Under your user account, go to :guilabel:`Security Credentials` tab, and click :guilabel:`Create access key button`.

   .. figure:: /images/AWSDeregisterSecurityCredentials.png

#. Replace ``<YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE ID>`` variable with your own wireless device ID.
   You can find it under :guilabel:`AWS IoT` → :guilabel:`Manage` → :guilabel:`LPWAN devices` → :guilabel:`Devices`.
   It is listed as :guilabel:`Device ID`.

   .. figure:: /images/AWSDeregisterWirelessId.png

#. Run the following command on your console:

   .. code-block:: console

     curl -X PATCH "https://api.iotwireless.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wireless-devices/<YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE ID>/deregister?WirelessDeviceType=Sidewalk" --user <AWS_ACCESS_KEY>:<AWS_SECRET_KEY> --aws-sigv4 "aws:amz:us-east-1:iotwireless"

   API response code should be 200 or 202.
