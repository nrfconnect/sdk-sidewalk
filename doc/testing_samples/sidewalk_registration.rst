Registering Sidewalk Endpoint
#############################

You can complete Sidewalk registration in one of the two ways:

 * Through an automatic touchless mode that uses Sidewalk Frustration-Free Networking (FFN) where no user interaction is required
 * Through a manual process by using a local machine to run a registration script and to connect to the Endpoint over Bluetooth LE

There are advantages of using automatic FFN registration:

 * There is no association between a user and the Sidewalk Endpoint.
   The Endpoint is allowed to connect to network without being associated to any user.
 * No Login with Amazon (LWA) is needed.
