Registering Sidewalk Endpoint
#############################

You can complete Sidewalk registration in one of the two ways:

 * Through an automatic touchless mode that uses Sidewalk Frustration-Free Networking (FFN) where no user interaction is required.

   .. note::
      There are advantages of using automatic FFN registration:

       * There is no association between a user and the Sidewalk Endpoint.
         The Endpoint is allowed to connect to network without being associated to any user.
       * No Login with Amazon (LWA) is needed.

 * Through a manual process by using a local machine to run a registration script and to connect to the Endpoint over Bluetooth LE.

For the exact instructions on both of these methods, refer to the `Registering and testing your Sidewalk endpoint`_ documentation.
