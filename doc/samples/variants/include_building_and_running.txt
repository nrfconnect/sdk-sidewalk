.. note::
   Before you flash your Sidewalk sample, make sure you have completed the following:

      * You downloaded the Sidewalk repository and updated west according to the :ref:`dk_building_sample_app` section.
      * You provisioned your device during the :ref:`setting_up_sidewalk_product`.

   This step needs to be completed only once.
   You do not have to repeat it for every sample rebuild.

To build the sample, follow the steps in the `Building and programming an application`_ documentation.
