Guidelines
-
- Imports:
    - Use only relative imports. Libraries must work as
    individual components and as external libraries.
- Configuration:
    - If your library needs user configuration, create file
    inside your Python module named <module>_config.py.
    Use the example at: libs/cloud/http_client/http_config.py
