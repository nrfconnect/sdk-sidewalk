                If operating in BLE mode the connection request has to be send before any message can be send.
                This config determines delay between connection requests

                After device has been registered and time sync the connection request has to be send. 
                This config determines the delay before first connection request

                Any notification send to cloud contain state of buttons, so if no message has been send for 
                BUTTON_PRESS_CHECK_PERIOD_SECS, the button state will be send.
